# Map-Of-RUC-Using-AR
C# scripts used for the logic behind the RUC map using AR.
As part of a group project, we designed an Android application in Unity (version 2022.3.40f1) that employs AR to guide users and students around RUC. For routing, the application implements navigation technologiy like the A* algorithm and polygon overlap avoidance. Each building on campus is treated as a destination with an entry point. The system has also accounted for the ongoing construction in 2025.
